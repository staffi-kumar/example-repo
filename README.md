Project Title: Album Management 
Project Description: This code sorts data stored in two lists. The lists store data for a class 'Album'. It store the name of the album, name of artist, and number of songs in the album. At first it sorts list1 by the number of songs in an album using merge sort. It then merges list1 and list2 and adds two extra albums to this merged list. It then sorts this merged list alphabetically with merge sort. Finally, the code also searches for specific albums in the list.
